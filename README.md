## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the characteristics of the NYC Citi Bike bussiness model. 
I did this through using tableau to visualized average ride times, trips by weekday and hour, and, in addition, broke all these metrics down by gender utilization.    

##Results
Conclusions from this analysis are based on this Tableau story.
Each bullet point represents a conclusion drawn the respective slide in the story.

-In the total users ride duration graph we see that rides peak at about 5 minutes with 145k users and rapidly drops off to around 30 mins with 20k users. The vast majority of rides last under an hour.

-For the Trips by Weekday and Hour heat map we can see that druing the work week most rides take place during 7 am and 5-6pm. Converesly, during the weekend the peak time spans from 9 or 10am to 7pm.

-The Users by Gender heat map seems to indicated that Men dominate the platform. The unknown group are also primarily 'Customers'

-The Ride Duration by Gender breakdown indicates that gender doesn't play a large role in duration preferences. The only exception seems to be that the unknown group plateaus at 7k riders from 10 minutes to 25 minutes.

-The Trips by Gender(By Weekday and Hour) seems to indicated that the unknown category are relatively active on Saturdays.

-Finally the Starting and Ending Locations indicated that most trips take place south of Central Park.
     
-The disparity in dot sizes in the ending locations are greater than the disparity in the starting locations. This could indicate that people are all ending their trips at popular tourist destinations.


##Summary

In short, people use this service for both tourism and commutes, they prefer short rides around 5 to 20 minutes, and men seem to have a relative predilection to the service in comparison to the other gender categories.

###Visualization Suggestions

-Ride Duration for User Type

-Start and End Locations by User Type

-Weekday vs Weekend comparisons of duration and locations
